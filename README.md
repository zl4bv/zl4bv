GitHub's CEO wants me to "[embrace AI or get out](https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-developers-embrace-ai-or-get-out-2025-8)". So I'm gone.

I'm a qualified engineer, not a developer, so it is my duty to consider the ethics and safety of humanity. These principles are incompatible with gen AI.

This account will remain alive for professional reasons. If this site is still home to your project, consider moving it elsewhere for better collaboration opportunities.
